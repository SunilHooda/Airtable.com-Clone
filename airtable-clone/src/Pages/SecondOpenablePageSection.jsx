          A customer experience strategy is an organized approach for delivering
          the best possible customer experience with your business across all
          touchpoints in their customer journey. It involves turning every
          customer interaction into a positive and meaningful experience so that
          it's easier to find new customers and convert existing customers into
          loyal fans.

        <Text p={5} fontSize="xl">
          A successful customer experience strategy, at a high level, starts
          with knowing your customers, understanding marketplace data and
          conditions, and deciding how your company's mission and vision fit
          into all of that. This process ideally includes gathering input and
          involving people from all departments in your organization, not just
          team members who are in customer-facing roles. By aligning all of your
          customer insights from across your company, you maximize your ability
          to build a better customer experience and create more long-term
          customer relationships.
